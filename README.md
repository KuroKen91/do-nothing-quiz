# Do Nothing Quiz - Just your everyday normal quiz :)

Do Nothing Quiz is a desktop app built in Python using PyQT5. 
This project was a chance for me to dive into the Python language for the first time while also building a GUI and desktop from scratch.

## Built With

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Language
* [PyQT5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) GUI
* [pyautogui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) For Mouse Control


## Getting Started

***Python3 installion on your local machine is required***

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 


### Installing

Everything you need is in the requirements.txt, so just a basic install from pip will suffice:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
or
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, activate the virtual environment:

** FOR WINDOWS USERS **

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Activate the project app by clicking on the green arrow (vscode) or by typing the following in the terminal:

```
python3 app.py
```

Have fun! 

Note: IP address functionality has been commented out, but feel free to use it if you wish for educational purposes.
